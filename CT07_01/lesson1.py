# Sample code:
# px_red = 1
# px_blue = 2
# px_green = 3

# num_red = 3
# num_blue = 5
# num_green = 4

# total = (px_red * num_red) + (px_blue * num_blue) + (px_green * num_green)

# print(total)

# score_one = 80
# score_two = 90
# score_three = 75

# total = score_one + score_two + score_three

# average_score = total / 3

# student_name = "Alex"

# print("Average score for " + student_name + " is: " + str(average_score))

# score = int(input("score please "))
# if score >= 75:
#     print("you got a")
# elif score >= 60:
#     print("you got b")
# elif score >= 50:
#     print("you got c")
# else:
#     print("fail")

# **Task: write a separate 'for' loop to print the following
# numbers:**

# 2. from 1 to 30
# 3. from 2 to 24 (in even numbers)
