# ## Recap 1: Riddler
# **Task: Using a while loop, code a riddler program**
# 1. Think of a riddle
# 2. Using the while loop, ask the user the riddle and
#    check the answer
# 3. While answer is not correct, repeat the question

# ans = "2"
# riddle = "( ( ( (16)^(1/3) - log2(64) + 8 * (2^4 / 2^2) )^(1/2) + (asin(0.5) / pi) ) / ( ( (3 + (7/2))^2 / (log(1000) - log(100)) )^(1/2) + (16)^(1/4) ) ) * 2 is what "

# userinput = input(riddle)
# while userinput != ans:
#     print("no.")
#     userinput = input(riddle)

# print("ok you pass")
