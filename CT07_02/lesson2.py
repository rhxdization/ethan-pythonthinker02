# recap 1

# **Task: write a separate 'for' loop to print the following
# numbers:**
# 1. from 0 - 20
# 2. from 1 to 30
# 3. from 2 to 24 (in even numbers)

# for i in range(2,25,2):
#     print(i)

# # Task 1: Introduction to while loop
# **Task: Using a separate 'while' loop, print each of the
# following:**
# 1. from 0 to 20
# 2. from 1 to 30
# 3. from 2 to 24

# skibidi = 2
# while skibidi <= 24:
#     print(skibidi)
#     skibidi+=1

# ## Task 2: while... break
# The **break** keyword will **break** out (exit) the loop.
# When a **break** is encountered, the code in the **else** will
# not be run.

# Using a while loop:
# 1. print the numbers from 1 to 10
# 2. if the number is 5, **break** out of the loop
